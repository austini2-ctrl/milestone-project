For this, I used some templates to help me take information from the original HTML and add it to the react app. Firstly, I tried my best to transfer over the gray theme. 
Once I get more comfortable, I plan on adding the gold and burnt orange accents. I also used this opporrunity to finally add cards and see how those would work in app. 
I also added the code for the ZIP file download for the different kinds of portfolio aspects. When I'm finally able to navigate better, I would see how to implement 
the hero, add more accessibility, and create a deeper column structure.
